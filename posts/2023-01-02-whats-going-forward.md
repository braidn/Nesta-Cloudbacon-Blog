To say it's been a bit of year would be more than an understatement.
However...

> It's been a bit of a year

For all the folks who don't know,
I spent the beginning of the year transitioning from [Glossier][glo] to [Orbit][orb],
having [Orbit][orb] implode financially,
racing to find and land a gig that before the end of 2022,
and finally finding a space at [PayNearMe][pnm].
With [Orbit][orb] and [PayNearMe][pnm] both being large [Rails][ror] apps.
Honestly, if in 2021 I was asked what technology I would be using in 2023,
[Rails][ror] would not have been my answer.

Throughout most of 2020 and 2021 [Glossier][glo] aimed to transition their own monolith to microservices.
This work was done by opting into the growing serverless world offered by [AWS][aws].
Ultimately, many of those products never saw the light of day.
And eventually opting to replatform to [Shopify][shp] instead.
Having worked on and even lead some of those initatives,
the world of serverless was top of mind.

The [Rails][ror] market though has exploded in the last couple of years.
Making a comeback that reminds me of the late 2012's throughout 2015.
Most of what a successful job search looks like (more on this soon)
is managing relationships with recruiters.
Those recruiters right now have large holes in their [Ruby][rb] or [Rails][ror] pipelines.
The flip side of this is the dearth of Serverless roles at the moment.

Serverless maybe something that's talked about widely by internal team members but,
there's very little of it talked about outside oranizations.
Doubly so when chatting about specific roles with hiring managers or internal recruiters.
Even bringing up concepts that apply to well architected applications lands flat with all but the most advanced engineers in interview loops.

Walking into a new [Rails][ror] gig isn't as easy as it was even 5 years ago.
