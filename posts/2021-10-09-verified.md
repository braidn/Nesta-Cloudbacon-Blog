'Many moons ago' there was this really interesting [startup that focused on security and identity management][keyb].
Like anything good,
they were quickly notickd by a [company that has consistently failed in this domain][zoom] and
found themselves purchased.
Like all 'good aquisitions',
the product became unusable shortly there after.

Queue the search for finding a way to verify my identity and others across the Internet!
Sure, one can pass around public keys (which is made fairly easy with GitHub),
but there really needs to be another way to do this that has an integrated search built in.

[Keys.pub][keys] happened to be mentioned in [my Twitter feed][twit] and looked to be a potential solution.
It uses [Saltpack][salt] for encrypted messaging,
keeps a searchable and importable list of keys that are importable via the CLI,
and even supports FIDO2 devices!
To top things off,
it's completely [open source][os].

If you want to exchange messages,
import my user from the kid for Twitter or GitHub from the following:

```shell
 curlie "https://keys.pub/user/search?q=braidn"
```

Excited to see how this platform changes and how accessible it makes Saltpack, key management and verification.
