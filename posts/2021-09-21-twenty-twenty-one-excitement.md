title: Things To Tickle My Fancy in 2021
date: '2021-09-21'

2021 has been a notable year on many fronts but,
it's also been a stellar one particularly for Technology.
There have benn all kinds of bright and shiney toys from SSG to i ...SSG,
GitHub's Copilot has taken over our day to day,
and there's even heresay of the [real real death of Webpack][ror7].

The following is a list of things that has personally captured my attention throughout the year.
Since it's only September, there is a high likelyhood that this will change as the year wanes to a close.
However, if anything does pop up, I'll be sure to share it here in some kind of 'addendum'.

Oh!
The below is also in no particular order.
Let's refrain from thinking that one of these items 'outweights' another.
They are all relatively exciting,
somewhat boring,
and mostly just a little better than the relevant competion that they all gathered on this list at precisely the same time.

1. [Astro.build][astro]

  There has been only a very shallow amount of exploration around the Astro community.
Throughout that short time of playing with this 'toolchain', I have been blown away.
The mere fact that Bob from accounting can write [VueJS][vue],
Tom from marketing can write [Svelte][svelte],
and it all compiles to a usable website is bonkers.
Especially for anyone who lived through the frontend framework wars of 2010 through 2016.

  As 2021 comes to an end, I will continue to play and prod with this toolchain when building [toy applications][pragprog].

1. [AWS CDK][cdk]

  AWS's Cloud Development Kit has been around for quite some time.
It's even likely to hit 2.0 in 2021 which is a huge feat for a large JavaScript project.
Pulumi has also recently introduced '[native AWS][paws]' support using AWS's recently released '[Cloud Control API][capi]' tool.
All of these tools are aimed at making Cloudformation much more maintainable and the resulting infrastructure easier to reason about.
Overall I am psyched to see where the DevOps as code tooling evolves in 2022.
