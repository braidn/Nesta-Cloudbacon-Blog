GitOps or DevOps (whatever you are doing) can really be a tricky thing when at a mid stage startup.
Security often times won't allow everyone to have access to deploy items to Production.
Moreover, it's tough to expect individuals to be able to run and observe services that they build.
This doesn't mean that engineers at these young startups are unable to build infrastructure,
they simply might not had the experience or mentorship to do so.

What this all leads to are smaller departments where this style of workstreams fall onto.
Sometimes they are called 'Platform' or 'Infrastructure' teams.
However, at the end of the day they tend to be a collection of engineers who are tasked
with keeping infrastructure needs checked off for the organization,
and pushing betterment in the realm of observability and other '[SRE][sre]' initiatives.

As you may have guessed,
these teams often run light due to how they are viewed as [cost centers][ccent].
Due to this,
individuals on this team are often times overworked with
a chronic amount of split priorities.
All of this leads to snowflake like devops focused solutions that
need constant gardening from the same small team that's historically overworked.

As an organization grows and really,
as they exit the size of most Series A or B startups,
they end up outgrowing this reality.
However, how can newer orgs or even CEO's plan to avoid these organizational hurdles?
