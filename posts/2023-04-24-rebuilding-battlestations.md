It's been some time since we have chatted about [battlestations][reddit].
So long actually that,
the old [27' Cinema Display][applDsplay],
has been long retired.

For quite some time through COVID,
there was a MacBook Pro on a floating arm on the right,
a [Cinema Display][applDsplay] in the center,
and horizontal 21 inch [ASUS ProArt][part] on the far right.
[Ergodox][egd], [HHKB][hhkb], and all other peripherals were driven from a single [Caldigit Dock][cdigit].
While this setup was by far the longest running [station][reddit] that I used,
it was far from ergonomic.

For starters (and this is more apparant than ever now),
a wide field of vision or 'many vertical wide screens',
cause me a lot of eye strain.
Because almost my entire field of vision was blocked by monitors,
it was also very hard to find a space to practice the now classic:
[20-20-20 rule][eyeStrain].
As with most individual contributors,
I spend most of my day steeped in code.
Either writing it but,
mostly digging through it.
This setup afforded a lot of horizontal space but,
is that a need when all files [are capped at 80 characters in length][wide]?
