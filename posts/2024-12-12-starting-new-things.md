title: Starting New Things.

It's been almost ten years since I have toyed with the idea of starting a company.
Historically, my focus has been around growing technology at burgeoning organizations.
Startups and early stage organizations go through growing pains and issues that
align with the specific startup's needs.

Having solved these specific problems a few times,
one not only establishes a keen understanding of the solution but,
can also anticipate when these problems may arise.
This 'superpower' is what all startups should be looking for in their hiring rounds.

Instead of looking for another space to flex this knowledge,
I am instead working on a small side project of my own.
Since the project will be mostly bootstrapped,
there will be a fairly long validation phase.
This will launch early on in 2025.

This space will remain a place for 'normal-ish' technical writings.
In the spirit of building in the open,
there will be a new route and collection of posts added
to [/inpublic](/#) in the coming week.

As always: next year is likely to be better than this year for this meandering deluge of non-AI driven anti-mouth blogging.
Here's to a year of more writing and sharing more of all the things!
