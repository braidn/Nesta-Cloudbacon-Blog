There hasn't been a whole lot of contact (here) throughout most of this year. 
This was due to me moving on from [Glossier][glo] at the end of last year.
There was a lot of writing on the wall that led to layoffs and it was almost blatently obvious.
Where did I go you might be asking?

I officially in December 2021 started at a wonderful startup named [Orbit][orb].
They are focused on quantifying how impactful [development relation][devRel] teams in tech organization.
Think GitHub or Salesforce.
They need to attract developers to their platforms so they hire a group of developer advocates to talk about how awesome they are.
These people,
like most jobs,
require metrics to work against and define success in the role.
These metrics tend to showcase how effective the entire team is when it comes to the greater community.
[Orbit][orb] provided the platform to both collect and interact with metrics around developer relation teams.

Fast forward to August of 2022 and the world of venture funded startups is much different now than at the end of 2021.
Although [consumer spending hasn't eased][noRecession],
there is a cooling of readily available venture funds at the moment.
Basically, we missed the boat when it came to working towards our Series B funding.
As of August, 15th I was technically a 'free agent' once more (will report in on how long that lasts)!

So with 9 or so months under my belt,
at a much smaller startup than the [Glossier][glo] I left,
